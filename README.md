# java-for-beginners
let's begin with  Java programming...

What is Java? 
Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language. Java was developed by James Gosling 
at Sun Microsystem in 1991. The first version of Java was released in 1995.

Java History:- 
 Company: Sun Microsystems (Oracle) 
 Designed By: James Gosling & his team 
 Idea: The Java idea came because designers wanted to create a language that should be 
simple, platform-independent, tight-coded programming language, etc 
 Name: Oak (Java) 
 Year: 1991 (development) -1995 (release) 
 Symbol: Coffee

Editions of Java:- 
1. J2SE: - Java 2 Standard Edition (Core Java) 
 In this edition, we learn Java fundamentals 
 Projects: Standalone Applications 
2. J2EE:- Java 2 Enterprise Edition (Advance Java)
 In this edition, we learn server-side programming 
 Projects: Enterprise Applications 
3. J2ME: -Java 2 Micro Edition (it has been replaced by Android) 
 In this edition, we learn microprogramming 
 Projects: Mobile Based Applications

// Features of Java programming...
1. Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented language that allows us to create modular programs and reusable code.

2. Platform Independent: Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code that can be run on multiple platforms - be it any operating system or architecture.

3. Multithreaded: Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming, which allows us to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.

4. Robust: Java has a strong memory management system. It helps in eliminating errors as it checks the code during compile and runtime.

5. Secure: Java is secured because it does not use explicit pointers and runs the programs inside the sandbox to prevent any activities from untrusted sources.

6. Distributed: Java has networking capabilities that make it a great choice for developing distributed computing applications.

7. High Performance: Java achieves high performance through the use of bytecode, which can be easily translated into native machine code.

8. Dynamic: Java is a dynamic language, it carries a lot of runtime information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at runtime.
